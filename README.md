## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

When CameraClick is running on your Android phone (even in the background), it **listens for incoming messages** from the Garmin companion app.  

When a message is received:
1. The app scans the screen using Android‚Äôs **Accessibility Service**.
2. It identifies all visible UI elements and locates the **largest clickable button**.
3. It simulates a click on that button to trigger a photo or video capture.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Because this action requires analyzing and interacting with other apps on the screen, **Accessibility permissions** are essential for CameraClick to function.
