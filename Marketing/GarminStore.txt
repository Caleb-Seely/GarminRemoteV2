CameraClick – Remote Shutter for Android
📸 Turn your Garmin watch into a remote shutter for your Android phone.
Perfect for creators, runners, group photos, and hands-free video capture, CameraClick gives you full control of your camera—right from your wrist.

🔧 Key Features
📷 Trigger your phone’s native camera app

⏱️ Use built-in tools: delay timer, flash, video, portrait

🧰 Works with your default camera—this tool just presses the button for you

⚙️ How It Works
CameraClick sends a command from your Garmin watch to the CameraClick Android companion app, running quietly in the background.
When your camera app is open, CameraClick finds the shutter button using Android's Accessibility Service—and presses it.
- No custom camera
- No cloud services
- Just fast, reliable remote control
