CameraClick – Remote Camera Shutter from Your Garmin Watch
📸 Effortlessly snap photos and record videos—hands-free—using your Garmin watch.

CameraClick connects your Garmin smartwatch with your Android phone to create a seamless remote camera experience. Whether you're capturing group shots, solo adventures, or recording video from a distance, CameraClick gives you wireless control right from your wrist.

📷 Uses Your Phone’s Native Camera App
CameraClick works with your existing camera app—not a custom viewer. It triggers the same camera you already use, preserving your preferred quality settings, lens choice, and storage path.

Using Android’s AccessibilityService, it interacts directly with the camera shutter button, making it compatible with a wide range of camera apps across devices. You keep full control over how your photos and videos are captured.
